# rit-book-club
A github repo for the UoS Research IT Book Club

## Usage

### File Structure
Directories in the repo follow a nested hierarchy:

Book -> Chapter -> {Subfolders}

Files should be created in the most appropriate location and given a unique name which identifies the contributor and the purpose of the file.

### Wiki

Use the wiki to store useful information in a searchable place. This could include notes or links to external resources that members might want to revisit.

### Discussion

Use the discussion area to ask questions or make announcements. 

**TO DO**
- [ ] Is this useful considering we have a slack channel?

## Code of Contribution

### Making a Pull Request
In order to contribute to the book club repo, the following steps must be taken:

1. Create a new branch. This branch should have a name that describes what work is being added and include your initials.
2. Work directly onto this branch
3. Open a pull request from your branch to the main branch.
4. Explain the changes made or feature added.
5. Request a review.

## What to use this github for
These are just some ideas :) in general it's a collaborative home for notes/thoughts about the bookclub, and a way for some of us to practice github.

* Sharing the code we've written during exercises
* Sharing useful info and links
* Sharing notes on the reading
* Feel free to add more!

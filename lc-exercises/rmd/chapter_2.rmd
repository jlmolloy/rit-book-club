# Q8

- I'm going to try to do the exercises with `tidyverse` commands instead

```{r}
# a
college <- read_csv("../data/College.csv")


college

```

```{r}

#b
college_tidy <- college %>% 
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(college = x1) %>%
  select(-x1) %>%
  mutate(rown = row_number())

glimpse(college_tidy)

```

```{r}
#c
summary(college_tidy)
```
- Discovered the `GGally` package and its `ggpairs` function

```{r}

# this is doing what it says but seems utterly pointless tbh

college_tidy %>%
  select(1:10, rown) %>%
  ggpairs(aes(colour = private))
```

```{r}
# iii
college_tidy %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y=outstate, colour = private))
```
